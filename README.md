# Runabout Java Library

This is a simple library for java projects which use [Runabout](https://www.runabout.dev) for replay debugging. 

It contains a few interfaces that can be used for exporting/logging json data about runtime objects in a format that can be read by the Runabout Intellij plugin and used to replay real scenarios in the IDE.

For documentation visit [docs.runabout.dev](https://docs.runabout.dev).
